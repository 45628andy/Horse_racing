# Horse Racing Winner Prediction

This project aims to predict the winner of a horse race given the track condition and characteristic of the horses in the sports sub-field. This is a part of our larger project on horse gambling prediction. We hope to develop a predictive model to forecast horse racing outcomes, allowing us to identify and implement profitable betting strategies. Using machine learning and predictive analytics techniques, we hope to be more informed about betting decisions.
